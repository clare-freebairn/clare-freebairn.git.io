Normal grass trees have natural problems, some are weak (but still useful) while others are non-functional, thus it is hard to find one that is useful. For all that they have various problems, they are fairly cheap to maintain and can be as big as one could wish. An example of a weak tree is the sharpening tree. These trees have branches that won't extend very far and are weak as well.

As a comparison, a strong tree, without branches, can look very much like the tree in the picture below.

Tree with sharpening. It is not going to become sharp.

Tree with weak branches. It is fully rounded and can be used for things other than bending or sharpening.

Awesome!


Please?


I have a boyfriend.


Wow.


Is he here?


Yeah.


Cool.


How do you do that?


How do you

We also wrote a lot of JavaScript programs, such as:


This language might have won a temporary popularity among our users, but it was not of long-term value, for we were not able to keep the software updated and the massive bandwidth usage it caused was no longer necessary.


So, if you really want to try writing JavaScript on the Web in 2000, then you should use Sunworks and Zebra, and hope for the best.

In the dark


I do what I want,

I must be high or else


I will take my chances,

And when my head bursts,

Then will all be over
